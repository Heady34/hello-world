Starter Repository for super newbie

I am a chemistry teacher who has taken a 14 year break from research.  When I was last active in research, I was an experimentalist who did very basic computations to support my experimental activities.  

I was a little intimidated by computational chemistry, so I actually favored the programs where you need to write your own scripts because they helped me keep track of what I was doing.  As I return to some simple research projects on the side (I am not research faculty, but primarily an instructor, but I've gotten to a point where I have some time to do small research on the side), I would like to get better with some of the popular open-source programming environments (specifically, python and R) because I am interested in providing some simple coding projects to my students.  

By graduation, some of my students wind up with different career goals, and feel a little like they did not make the best use of their time in college.  (i.e. some students are no longer interested in PhDs or med-school, but they filled their transcript with biology and chemistry courses, and left no room for business or computer science courses and feel behind).  Some coding exercises would have direct utility toward solving chemical problems, but hopefully also provide experiences that are valuable for the students who are starting to lean toward moving away from chemistry.  

We do a lot of team-projects in my department, and being able to have teams code together would be great.  Therefore, I feel it is in my best interest to explore GitHub to find out how we might use it in class in future semesters.
